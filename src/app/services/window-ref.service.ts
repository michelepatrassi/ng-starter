// Referencing global browser objects like 'document' or 'window' directly from within your code is possible,
// but not encouraged and considered bad practice.

// Especially since Angular 2 isnâ€™t only designed to run within your browser,
// but also on mobile, the server or web workers where objects like 'window' may not be available.

// Therefore the suggested approach is to wrap such objects and inject them
// through the dependency injection mechanism. This way it is possible to change
// the concrete runtime instance of a given object based on the environment
// the Angular application is running.
